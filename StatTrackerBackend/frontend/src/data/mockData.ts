    recap_body: `In a slugfest at Diamond Park, Mike Torres put on an absolute clinic, going 4-for-5 with two mammoth home runs to lead the Diamond Crushers to a convincing 12-8 victory over the Fastball Fanatics.

Torres wasted no time making his presence felt, launching a solo shot in the bottom of the first to give the Crushers an early 1-0 lead. He'd strike again in the fourth with a three-run blast that proved to be the difference maker.

The Fanatics battled back behind Jason Chen's three-hit performance, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Crushers' offensive onslaught. David Martinez added three hits and two RBIs of his own, keeping the Fanatics' pitching staff on their heels all night.

"Mike was locked in from the first pitch," said Crushers skipper Tom Reynolds. "When he's seeing the ball like that, he's unstoppable." The win improves the Crushers to 8-4 on the season.`,
